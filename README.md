# memic_model
Model of cancer growth under spatially heterogeneous oxygen

## Tentative specs:

*Definitely necessary*
- Population of cells
- Cells can be in different states
- Cells can reproduce (sometimes with mutations)
- Environmental conditions vary over space
- Environmental conditions vary over time (based on diffusion equations?)
- Environmental conditions can affect cell reproduction, death, and behavior
- Ability to eventually simulate applying treatments

*Possibly necessary*
- Complex topology: 3D, free-moving cells (i.e. continuous x,y coordinates rather than lattice), something else?
- Variation in cell proliferation ability
- Cell movement (preferential based on environment?)
- Non-neutral mutations (and possibly mutations with differential effects based on environment)
- Phenotypic plasticity
- Physics
